                history: "Formed approximately 100,000 years ago, repeated volcanic eruptions gradually transformed Mt. Fuji into the largest mountain in Japan, at 3,776 meters tall. The last eruption in 1707 lasted for 16 days, with volcanic ash reaching as far as Tokyo. Volcanic activity is also responsible for creating Hoeizan (one of Fuji's secondary peaks), the five lakes at the mountain's base, and numerous caves near Aokigahara Forest. The area is also blessed with many mineral-rich hot springs, making the region a paradise for both outdoor recreation and relaxation.Over the centuries, the Japanese have forged a spiritual bond with the mountain. Legend has it that notable religious ascetic Hasegawa Kakugyo (1541–1646) summited the mountain over 100 times. His feats led to the formation of Fuji-ko, a group of likeminded Mt. Fuji worshippers. The sect built shrines, created rock monuments, and fasted to show their dedication.",

The hill is rocky and steep on all sides except for the western side, and has an extensive, nearly flat top. Strong fortification walls have surrounded the summit of the Acropolis for more than 3,300 years. The first fortification wall was built during the 13th century BC, and surrounded the residence of the local Mycenaean ruler. In the 8th century BC, the Acropolis gradually acquired a religious character with the establishment of the cult of Athena, the city’s patron goddess. The sanctuary reached its peak in the archaic period (mid-6th century to early 5th century BC). In the 5th century BC, the Athenians, empowered from their victory over the Persians, carried out an ambitious building programme under the leadership of the great statesman Perikles, comprising a large number of monuments including the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Propylaia and the temple of Athena Nike.",
